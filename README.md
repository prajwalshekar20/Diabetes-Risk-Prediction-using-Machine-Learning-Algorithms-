# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-


Developed a machine learning model for diabetes risk prediction using algorithms such as Random Forest,
Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree, achieving 98% accuracy with Random Forest.
Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and SMOTE for dataset balancing, with model
performance evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
